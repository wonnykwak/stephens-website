In response to this, many new concepts to prevent automobile crashes reached the spotlight such as autonomous vehicles. However, the dependability of Artificial Intelligence and its decision-making abilities became subject to question. One miscalculation can result in the cost of one's life. Therefore, what should an autonomous vehicle do under dilemma situations? Faced with a trolley situation, should the AI choose to crash into pedestrians to protect the driver, or drive off a cliff to save the pedestrians...

Additionally, leadership plays a prominent role in controlling the tempo and the well-being of a camp. Unorganized leadership ultimately leads to chaos, resulting in a bad experience for all parties.
