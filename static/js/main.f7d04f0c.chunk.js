In response to this, many new concepts to prevent automobile crashes reached the spotlight such as autonomous vehicles. However, the dependability of Artificial Intelligence and its decision making abilities became subject to question. One miscalculation can result at the cost of one's life. Therefore, how should an autonomous vehicle do under dilemma situations? Faced with a trolley situation, should the AI choose to crash into pedestrians to protect the driver, or drive off a cliff to save the pedestrians... These are the types of questions that I aimed to gain data on while conducting independent research under the guidance of Stanford Professor, Tom Kosnik. I researched about the ethical dilemmas regarding autonomous vehicles by analyzing the data from my survey that I sponsored on Amazon Mechanical Turk.",link:"Experience-Page"},{key:2,image:"images/cairolab.png",title:"University of Colorado Boulder: Summer AI Research Program",date:"June 2020 - November 2020",location:"Boulder, CO",position:"Research Assistant",description:"Would you trust Artificial Intelligence?

Does justification matter in providing a sense of trust? These are the questions that my research at the Cairo Lab of the University of Colorado Boulder consisted of. Working with PhD student Aaquib Tabrez, my partner and I expanded on Aaquib's previous research. We aimed to confirm whether providing justification impacted a person's impression of the AI machine. We set this research up by developing an online car racing game generated by AI. Before the racing game, the participant was informed that the AI is omnipotent and would always be correct. However, during the simulation, the AI gave out both correct and incorrect instructions to the participant. After the game, the participant was asked to complete a survey utilized to measure their trust in the AI. During this process I was able to experience hands-on coding with python, SQL, and JS whilst learning about the International Review Board and survey design.",link:"Experience-Page"},{key:3,image:"images/stanfordneurodiversity.jpeg",title:"Stanford Medicine: SNP Reach",date:"June 2020 - July 2020",location:"Stanford, CA",position:"Student",description:"My time at Stanford's Neurodiversity Project was eye-opening.

Almost like I was thrown into the wild, I was in charge of directing multiple sports camps such as the NFL Football camp and a Volleyball camp. These camps consisted of 20 or more children ages ranging from 6 all the way to 14. The most valuable lessons that I learned from this program was the importance of problem-solving, leadership, and patience. When working with children, many problems such as fighting or verbal abuse. During these events, mediating the problem properly is the priority so that the situation is prevented in the future. Additionally, leadership plays a prominent role in controlling the tempo and the well-being of a camp. Unorganized leadership ultimately leads to choas, resulting in a bad experience for all parties. Finally, patience: I learned how acting out rashly only negatively impacts yourself, and how 'patience is a virtue'.
